## Core Features:

- Profile Hero: Display a profile picture, name, and short bio at the top of the page.
- Link List: A vertically aligned list of links, each with a custom label and URL.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark violet (#5B308A) to subtly compliment the vibrancy of the background shader.
- Background color: Near-black (#080808) to allow the shader background to pop without overwhelming the page.
- Accent color: Pale yellow (#FAF0AC) to offset the primary hue with added visual interest.
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif for clean, minimalist readability.
- Centralized layout with a maximum width of 420px for optimal viewing on all devices.
- Use GSAP fadeIn animations when buttons load.
- Minimal iconography within buttons to match the elegant theme.
